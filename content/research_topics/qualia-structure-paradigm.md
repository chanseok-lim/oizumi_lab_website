title: Qualia structure paradigm
weight: 1
description: We quantify the quality of consciousness, or qualia, based on the
  relational structure of subjective experiences. By obtaining qualia structures
  from psychological experiments, we can compare them across individuals or
  relate them to the relational structures of neural activity.
