title: Integrated Information Theory (IIT)
weight: 10
description: We are working on the theoretical development and experimental
  verification of Integrated Information Theory (IIT). Specifically, we are
  developing practical algorithms to quantify IIT-based quantities, such as
  integrated information and the "complex" (informational core) in real neural
  data.
