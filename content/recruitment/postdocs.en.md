title: "Postdoc Recruitment"
---

As of December 1, 2025, the Oizumi Laboratory is recruiting 1-2 postdoctoral researchers to conduct research related to the following themes.

1. **Translation and control of information between different brains**
2. **Characterization of different brain states (conscious, unconscious, etc.) from the perspectives of stochastic thermodynamics and control theory**
3. **Inter-individual comparison of the structure of subjective relationships (qualia structure) and its neural basis**

The degree of freedom in the specific research theme is high, and it is possible to set a theme that respects each individual's wishes to the maximum extent. In addition, employment is possible even for themes other than those listed above, as long as they are related to the research being conducted in the laboratory. If you are interested in any related research themes, we would be happy if you would consider applying.

We also hope for someone who can actively take charge of research guidance for students. Of course, the premise is that you can secure enough time for your own research, and we will ask you to provide guidance on research themes that match your own research interests.

We also welcome the opportunity to speak with you once before applying. Please feel free to contact us. For applications, please contact Oizumi by email (c-oizumi atmark g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp).

## 1. Introduction to the Laboratory
The Oizumi Laboratory was established on April 1, 2019. It is a laboratory that works on theoretical research in neuroscience, especially theoretical research on consciousness.
Currently (December 2025), there are 3 postdoctoral researchers, 9 doctoral students, 5 master's students, and 2 undergraduate students. I think it is a lively laboratory where enthusiastic researchers and students gather. Those who are appointed as specially appointed researchers may conduct joint research not only with me but also with other laboratory members depending on the case.
In the laboratory, we hold group meetings where people with similar research themes gather to report their progress, as well as individual meetings, once every two weeks. We value time for discussion with laboratory members, and our style is to advance research through discussion.

## 2. Policy on Joint Research with Postdoctoral Researchers
Basically, you will conduct research themes related to projects currently being undertaken in the laboratory jointly with Oizumi. However, rather than the specific research being already fixed, we will create an appropriate one through discussion with the researcher. I believe that each individual has their own research interests/preferences and strengths/weaknesses, so we will set a research theme that is mutually satisfactory after considering all of them. I also welcome proposals from unique perspectives that I am not currently considering. Although there are rough theme settings, my first priority is to do interesting science and to make it a research theme that the person can work on with the most enthusiasm, so in that sense, I think the degree of freedom in research is high.
Also, since I myself have experienced being a postdoc for more than 8 years before reaching my current tenure position, I will give consideration to the career path of postdoctoral researchers. Specifically, I can provide the following support:
* Appropriate theme setting and time management so that papers can be published during the tenure
* Encouragement to apply for competitive funds such as KAKENHI and advice on preparing application forms
* Advice on preparing application documents for open recruitment, handling interviews, etc.
