overview: >-
  Our laboratory aims to elucidate the mechanisms of subjective experience
  through mathematical theories. We broadly categorize the problems of
  consciousness into three pillars: 1) the quality of consciousness (content),
  2) the levels of consciousness (states), and 3) the location of consciousness
  (neural substrates). We address fundamental questions such as: What determines
  the qualitative difference between visual and auditory experiences? Why does
  consciousness fade during deep sleep? Our primary working hypothesis is
  Integrated Information Theory (IIT), which posits that the essence of
  consciousness lies in "intrinsic information". While we utilize the framework
  of IIT as a starting point, our primary focus is to overcome the theoretical
  and computational limitations that currently hinder the scientific testing of
  such mathematical theories.\

  To bridge the gap between abstract theory and biological reality, we are developing a comprehensive framework for verification that extends beyond any single theory. We address the challenge of quantifying subjective experience through a structural approach, focusing on the relational geometry of "qualia structures." Simultaneously, to handle the complexity of large-scale neural systems, we employ mathematical tools such as dynamical systems theory, network control theory, and stochastic thermodynamics. These tools allow us to characterize causal relationships in the brain and develop practical algorithms for computing information-theoretic quantities that were previously infeasible.


  By combining these mathematical methodologies with experimental collaborations, we aim to unite theory and data. For example, we analyze neural activity during sleep and anesthesia to verify if theoretical measures correctly track changes in consciousness levels. We also investigate whether the mathematical structure of consciousness correlates with psychophysical data. Ultimately, our goal is to establish a rigorous empirical foundation for testing not only IIT but consciousness theories in general. By facilitating fair comparisons among competing hypotheses, we aim to advance beyond current theoretical limitations and bridge the gap between subjective experience and neural activity.


  Below, we introduce specific research projects addressing these topics.
